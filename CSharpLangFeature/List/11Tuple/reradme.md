# Tuples
* C# tuples are types that you define using a lightweight syntax. 
* The advantages include a simpler syntax, rules for conversions based on number (referred to as cardinality) and types of elements, and consistent rules for copies, equality tests, and assignments.
* A tuple is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different data types. 
* It can be used where you want to have a data structure to hold an object with properties, but you don't want to create a separate type for it.





```csharp
    Tuple<T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, TRest>
    Tuple<int, string, string> person = new Tuple <int, string, string>(1, "Steve", "Jobs");
```

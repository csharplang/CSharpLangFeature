#### C# HashTable
* The Hashtable in C# is a collection that stores (Keys, Values) pairs. Here, the Keys are used to find the storage location. A HashTable is immutable and cannot have duplicate entries. The .Net Framework has provided a HashTable class that contains all the functionality required to implement a hashtable without any extra coding.


#### Linked List Implementation in C#
* A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 
* In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
